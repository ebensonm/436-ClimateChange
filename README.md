# Climate Change
Climate Modeling Project

In the ClimateModel folder, there are files for running and animating Budyko-Sellers climate models with subtle modifications (described in the pdf in the same folder)

In the OptimalControl folder, there is an optimal control problem using the Budyko-Sellers model. More details are also found in the pdf file in the same folder.

The data folder, contains real temperature profile data, as well as some animations and figures described in both project pdfs.
There are animations for both the ClimateModel project and the OptimalControl project found in appropriately named folders in the Data directory.
